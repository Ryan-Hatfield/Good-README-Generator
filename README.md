## Installation
Inside the terminal of my application folder the following commands were ran to generate the .json files and the dependencies: 
  - npm init
  - npm install
  
During the coding process, in order to test the application the "node index.js" was used.

## Usage
After the user runs "npm init" and "npm install", the user will then run "node index.js". The user will then be presented with a series of prompts. Afer the prompts have ran through, the README.md file will be generated in their current folder.

Below are some screen shots of an example of a generated file.
